<h1>:heavy_check_mark: 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree</h1>
<blockquote>
Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

* **Example 1**:<br>
![Tree](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/26/tmp-tree.jpg)

        Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
        Output: 3

* **Example 2**:<br>

        Input: root = [1,null,2]
        Output: 2


### **Constraints** 

        The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
        -100 <= Node.val <= 100
