<h1>:heavy_check_mark: 102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal</h1>
<blockquote>
Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).
</blockquote>

* **Example 1**:<br>
![Tree](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/tree1.jpg)

        Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
        Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]

* **Example 2**:<br>

        Input: root = [1]
        Output: [[1]]


### **Constraints** 

        The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
        -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
